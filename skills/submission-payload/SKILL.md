# HSSI Submission Payload Specification

Build a high-fidelity HSSI submission payload by mapping `hssi_metadata.md` sections to API JSON fields.

> **WARNING: Every POST to `/api/submission/` is irreversible.** It creates a permanent database record and sends a confirmation email to the submitter. There is no sandbox, dry-run, undo, or delete. Build the payload correctly here — do not probe the API with test or partial payloads. If you're unsure about a field's format, consult the example payload or ask the user.

The authoritative API specification lives in the `hssi-website` repo:
- `concept/import_submission_notes.md` — endpoint spec, field list, object schemas
- `concept/import_submission.json` — curated example payload in the new format
- `django/website/views/api/software_api.py` — the DRF `SubmissionAPI` view
- `django/website/models/serializers/submission.py` — the `SubmissionSerializer` (validation + creation logic)

This skill distills that spec into actionable mapping rules. If anything here conflicts with those files, the `hssi-website` source wins.

## API Endpoint

- **Method:** `POST /api/submission/` (note the trailing slash)
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Root format:** JSON array (even for a single submission)
- Each array item is one submission object
- **Success status:** HTTP 201 Created
- **Response:** `{"status": "ok", "count": N, "results": [{"index": 0, "softwareId": "<uuid>"}, ...]}`

### Field name convention

The new DRF-based endpoint uses `CamelCaseJSONRenderer` and `decamelize_data()` to automatically convert camelCase JSON keys to snake_case internally. **Submit with camelCase keys** (e.g., `softwareName`, `codeRepositoryUrl`, `givenName`, `familyName`). The backend serializer accesses the snake_case equivalents (`software_name`, `code_repository_url`, `given_name`, `family_name`) after decamelization.

Snake_case keys will also work because decamelizing an already-snake_case key is a no-op, but camelCase is the documented convention for this endpoint.

---

## Required Fields (Per Object)

Each submission object **must** include these five fields:

### `submitter` (array of Submitter objects)
```json
"submitter": [
  {
    "email": "user@example.org",
    "person": {
      "givenName": "Jane",
      "familyName": "Doe",
      "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000"
    }
  }
]
```
- DB match is on `email` (case-insensitive)
- `person` is a Person object (see Object Specifications below)

### `softwareName` (string)
```json
"softwareName": "PackageName"
```

### `codeRepositoryUrl` (string URL)
```json
"codeRepositoryUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo"
```
**Note:** The payload key is `codeRepositoryUrl` (lowercase `rl`). Some response representations may render this as `codeRepositoryURL` (uppercase `RL`). Always use lowercase in submissions.

### `authors` (array of Person objects)
```json
"authors": [
  {
    "givenName": "Jane",
    "familyName": "Doe",
    "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000",
    "affiliation": [
      {
        "name": "Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics",
        "identifier": "https://ror.org/012345678"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
- `givenName` and `familyName` are required per author
- DB hard match is on `identifier` (when present); falls back to `givenName` + `familyName`

### `description` (string)
```json
"description": "Full description of the software..."
```

---

## Object Specifications

### Person
- `givenName` (required) — string
- `familyName` (required) — string
- `identifier` — URL: an **ORCID** for a person author, or a **ROR** for an organization author (see "Organization authors" below)
- `affiliation` — array of Organization objects

**Organization authors** — see `hssi-field-definitions/fields/06-authors.md` (Payload and roundtrip notes) for how a ROR-identified author is encoded.

### Submitter
- `email` (required) — string
- `person` (required) — Person object

### Organization
- `name` (required) — string
- `identifier` — URL (typically ROR for institutions)

### Instrument / Observatory
- `name` (required) — string — **the matched controlled-list row's `name`, copied verbatim**. (That
  name is typically the SPASE name with any parenthetical abbreviation already stripped — e.g.
  `Parker Solar Probe`, not `Parker Solar Probe (PSP)` — but don't re-derive it; use the row's value.)
- `identifier` — URL — the SPASE Resource ID (`https://spase-metadata.org/...`) from the controlled
  list. **Strongly preferred:** it is the reliable de-duplication key (see Backend Quirks).
- Do **not** send a `landing_url` — that field is server-derived (a HelioData mission page when one is
  confirmed to exist; otherwise empty so the link falls back to the SPASE `identifier`) and is ignored
  on submission. Agents only ever set `name` and `identifier`.

**Relevance gate and SPASE resolution:** the single authoritative procedure is `hssi-field-definitions/fields/31-related-instruments.md` (Field 32 defers to it). Entries reach the payload only after passing it; never emit a `name` without a SPASE `identifier`.

### Award
- `name` (required) — string
- `identifier` — string (award number/code — not validated as URL)

### Version
- `number` (required) — string (semantic version)
- `releaseDate` — string (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `description` — string
- `versionPid` — URL (typically a DOI)

## Controlled-List Endpoints

The field → model endpoint table lives in one place: `hssi-field-definitions/sources/vocabulary-authority.md`. Normalize values to **exact** strings from the `name` field of the endpoint on the target base URL.

**How to use:** Fetch each relevant endpoint, extract the `name` field from each row, and normalize your metadata values to match exactly. If an extracted value doesn't match any controlled-list entry, flag it for user review rather than silently dropping it.

**Software Functionality format:** see `hssi-field-definitions/fields/04-software-functionality.md` (Payload and roundtrip notes).

---

## Normalization Rules

1. **"Not found" means omit** — If a metadata section says "Not found", omit that field from the payload entirely. Do not include `"fieldName": "Not found"`.

2. **Strip source/note prose** — Metadata values may include annotations like `(Source: CITATION.cff)` or `Note: ...`. Strip these to extract only the actual value.

3. **Preserve URLs as-is** — Do not modify URL values. Keep them exactly as extracted.

4. **Exact controlled-list strings** — For fields backed by controlled lists, use the exact string from the endpoint's `name` field. No close-enough matching.

5. **Author name splitting** — If the metadata has full names (e.g., "Jane M. Doe"), split into `givenName: "Jane M."` and `familyName: "Doe"`. Use the last space-separated token as `familyName`, everything before as `givenName`.

6. **Date normalization** — All dates must be ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`. If only a year is given, use `YYYY-01-01`.

7. **DOI normalization** — DOIs should be full URLs: `https://doi.org/10.XXXX/XXXXX`.

---

## Known Backend Quirks

1. **`codeRepositoryUrl` vs `codeRepositoryURL`** — Submit with lowercase `Url`. Some response representations may return `URL` (uppercase). Both refer to the same field.

2. **Email notifications** — The endpoint sends a confirmation email to the submitter after the DB commit, via `email_existing_edit_link()`. The email send happens **outside** the atomic transaction (after it commits), so an email failure will NOT roll back the submission — but it can still produce an error response even though the DB record was created. Always check the record exists before concluding that a submission failed.

3. **Object deduplication** — The backend matches existing DB records:
   - Person: by `identifier` (ORCID for a person, or ROR for an organization author) first, then by `givenName`+`familyName`
   - Submitter: by `email` (case-insensitive)
   - Organization: by `identifier` first, then by `name` (case-insensitive)
   - InstrumentObservatory: by `identifier` first, then by `name`+`type`. **The name fallback is a case-sensitive exact match** (`filter(name=..., type=...).first()`, unlike the case-insensitive matching used for most other models), so any drift in spelling, casing, or an embedded abbreviation (`Parker Solar Probe (PSP)` vs the canonical `Parker Solar Probe`) silently creates a **duplicate** row. And because it takes `.first()`, a name that exactly matches **several** identically-named rows (e.g. the four `Solar Ultraviolet Imager` GOES rows) binds to an **arbitrary** one — which is why a collision must be omitted entirely, not sent as a bare name (see the resolution steps under Instrument / Observatory). Always send the SPASE `identifier` to bind to the canonical entry reliably.
   - Award: by `identifier` first, then by `name` (case-insensitive)
   - RelatedItem (publications/datasets/software): by `identifier` (URL). Reuse preserves the
     existing row's semantic `type`; submitting the same URL under a different relation does not
     retype it.
   - Keyword: case-insensitive name match, created if missing

   If a match is found with fewer fields, the DB record is enriched (empty fields filled in). If a match is found with conflicting fields, the existing DB values win.

4. **SoftwareEditQueue creation** — A 90-day edit queue entry is created for each submission (outside the atomic block, after the serializer commits). The `queueId` is not returned in the response — look it up via `/api/models/SoftwareEditQueue/rows/all/` if you need it for verification.

5. **No `submissionId` in response** — Unlike the legacy `/api/submit` endpoint, the new endpoint returns only `softwareId` per result (no `submissionId`).

6. **No dry-run or test mode** — The HSSI API has no sandbox endpoint, no dry-run flag, no email suppression option, and no mechanism to delete submitted records. Every `POST /api/submission/` unconditionally creates a permanent database record and sends a confirmation email. The `submitter.email` field is required. There is no way to submit "silently" or "for testing." Treat every POST as a production action with permanent consequences.
