# Extraction sources — the autofill cascade and registries

<!-- Moved verbatim from resource_submission_form_fields.md lines 786-984 on 2026-09-22. Cross-field: each stage maps
     several fields to a source path. Field-specific consequences also appear in the relevant fields/NN file. -->

The HSSI web form supports automated metadata extraction through a cascade of API calls. AI agents can replicate this behavior to pre-fill many form fields automatically.

### Autofill Cascade Overview

The form uses a three-stage cascade when a DOI is provided:

1. **DataCite API** → Extract basic metadata from the DOI
2. **Zenodo API** (if applicable) → Get additional version and repository information
3. **SoMEF** → If a code repository URL was found, extract metadata directly from the repository

Each stage adds more metadata, with later stages filling in gaps or providing more detailed information.

---

### Stage 1: DataCite API

**Endpoint:** `https://api.datacite.org/dois/{DOI}`

**Example:** `https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.5281/zenodo.13287868`

**Fields Extracted:**
- **Software Name** (from `attributes.titles[].title`)
- **Description** (from `attributes.descriptions[]` where `descriptionType` may be "Abstract")
- **Concise Description** (from short descriptions ≤200 chars or truncated description)
- **Authors** with sub-fields:
  - Author name (from `attributes.creators[].name` or `givenName` + `familyName`)
  - Author Identifier (from `attributes.creators[].nameIdentifiers[]`): an **ORCID** (`nameIdentifierScheme` = "ORCID") for person creators, or a **ROR** (`nameIdentifierScheme` = "ROR", usually with `nameType` = "Organizational") for organization creators
  - Affiliations (from `attributes.creators[].affiliation[]`)
- **Publisher** (from `attributes.publisher`)
- **Publication Date** (from `attributes.dates[]` where `dateType` = "Issued")
- **License** name and URI (from `attributes.rightsList[]`)
- **Funders** (from `attributes.fundingReferences[].funderName`)
- **Awards** (from `attributes.fundingReferences[].awardTitle` and `awardNumber`)
- **Version Number** (from `attributes.version`)
- **Keywords** (from `attributes.subjects[].subject`)
- **Code Repository URL** (from `attributes.relatedIdentifiers[]` where `relationType` = "IsDerivedFrom" and `relatedIdentifierType` = "URL")
- **Documentation URL** (from `attributes.relatedIdentifiers[]` where `relationType` = "IsDocumentedBy")
- **Reference Publication** (from `attributes.relatedIdentifiers[]` where `relationType` = "IsDescribedBy")
- **Related Publications** (from `attributes.relatedIdentifiers[]` where `resourceTypeGeneral` is publication-related)
- **Related Datasets** (from `attributes.relatedIdentifiers[]` where `resourceTypeGeneral` = "Dataset")
- **Related Software** (from `attributes.relatedIdentifiers[]` where `resourceTypeGeneral` is software-related)

**How to replicate:**
```bash
# Example: Get metadata for a DOI
curl "https://api.datacite.org/dois/10.5281/zenodo.13287868"
```

---

### Stage 2: Zenodo API (Conditional)

**Endpoint:** `https://zenodo.org/api/records/{RECORD_ID}`

**When to use:** If the DOI is a Zenodo DOI (contains "zenodo" in the DOI)

**Example:** For DOI `10.5281/zenodo.13287868`, extract record ID `13287868` and query:
`https://zenodo.org/api/records/13287868`

**Additional Fields Extracted:**
- **Concept DOI** (from `conceptdoi`) - The DOI for all versions, not just one version
- **Version PID** (from `doi`) - The DOI for this specific version
- **Code Repository URL** (from `metadata.custom["code:codeRepository"]` - alternative source)
- **Development Status** (from `metadata.custom["code:developmentStatus"]`)
- **Programming Languages** (from `metadata.custom["code:programmingLanguage"][]`)

**How to replicate:**
```bash
# Extract Zenodo record ID from DOI
RECORD_ID=$(echo "10.5281/zenodo.13287868" | grep -oP 'zenodo\.\K\d+')

# Query Zenodo API
curl "https://zenodo.org/api/records/${RECORD_ID}"
```

---

### Stage 3: SoMEF (Conditional)

**When to use:** If a code repository URL was found in Stage 1 or Stage 2

**Tool:** [SoMEF](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef) (Software Metadata Extraction Framework)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install somef
```

**Command:**
```bash
somef describe -t 0.7 -r {REPOSITORY_URL} -o output.json
```

**Fields Extracted:**
- **Persistent Identifier** (from `identifier[].result.value`)
- **Authors** with names and URLs (from `authors[].result`)
- **Software Name** (from `full_title[].result.value` or `name[].result.value`, choosing highest confidence)
- **Description** (from `description[].result.value`, may combine multiple with similar confidence)
- **Publication Date** (from `date_created[].result.value`)
- **Version Number** (from `version[].result.value`, choosing newest version)
- **Version Date** (from `date_updated[].result.value`)
- **Programming Languages** (from `programming_languages[].result.value`)
- **License** (from `license[].result` with `spdx_id` or `name`)
- **Keywords** (from `keywords[].result.value`, comma-separated)
- **Development Status** (from `repository_status[].result.description`)
- **Documentation URL** (from `documentation[].result.value`, prioritizing non-repository domains)
- **Logo** (from `logo[].result.value`)

**Notes:**
- SoMEF uses confidence scores; the implementation chooses results with highest confidence
- SoMEF can be slow (may take 30+ seconds for large repositories)
- The threshold `-t 0.7` means only results with ≥70% confidence are included
- Output format `-o` produces JSON-LD format

**How to replicate:**
```bash
# Example: Extract metadata from a GitHub repository
somef describe -t 0.7 -r https://github.com/SuperDARN/pydarn -o pydarn_metadata.json

# Read the output
cat pydarn_metadata.json
```

### PyHC Package Metadata

**What is PyHC?** The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) maintains a registry of Python packages used in heliophysics research. If the software being submitted is a PyHC package, additional curated metadata may be available.

**PyHC Registry Files:**
PyHC maintains its package registry in three YAML files on GitHub. An AI agent should check all three to determine if the package is registered:

1. **Core packages:** https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/blob/main/_data/projects_core.yml
2. **Community packages:** https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/blob/main/_data/projects.yml
3. **Unevaluated packages:** https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/blob/main/_data/projects_unevaluated.yml

**Fields Available in PyHC Metadata:**
- **name** - Package name
- **description** - Package description
- **logo** - URL to package logo
- **docs** - Documentation URL
- **code** - Code repository URL
- **contact** - Primary contact/maintainer
- **keywords** - Array of keywords (may include domain-specific terms like "ionosphere_thermosphere_mesosphere", "magnetospheres", "solar", etc.)
- **community** - Quality rating for community engagement
- **documentation** - Quality rating for documentation
- **testing** - Quality rating for testing coverage
- **software_maturity** - Quality rating for software maturity
- **python3** - Quality rating for Python 3 compatibility
- **license** - Quality rating for license clarity

**How to check:**

1. **Read all three YAML files completely** - Don't use grep or search for specific terms, as you might use the wrong search term and miss a match
2. **Parse each file** and examine all entries to find matches based on:
   - Package name (may differ slightly from repository name)
   - Repository URL (code field)
   - Package description content
3. If found, extract the metadata from that entry
4. Use PyHC metadata to supplement other sources

**Example approach:**
```bash
# Download all three PyHC registry files for complete analysis
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/main/_data/projects_core.yml" -o pyhc_core.yml
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/main/_data/projects.yml" -o pyhc_community.yml
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/main/_data/projects_unevaluated.yml" -o pyhc_unevaluated.yml

# Then parse each YAML file in its entirety to check for matches
# (Use a YAML parser to read all entries and compare against the package being analyzed)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Not all heliophysics packages are PyHC packages - absence from these files does not indicate a problem
- PyHC metadata is curated by the community and is considered more definitive/accurate than auto-extracted metadata
- The quality ratings (Good, Partially met, etc.) can inform the Development Status field
- PyHC keywords may map to HSSI's Related Region, Software Functionality, or Keywords fields
- **Its `logo:` value is an exception to that curation.** The registry's logo URLs are commonly
  branch-referenced (`.../main/...`) and sometimes point at a file that no longer exists. Treat the
  registry as authoritative about **which asset** is the project's logo, not about the URL string:
  re-derive the URL from the repository and pin it per the Field 33 guidance. Recording the registry's
  string verbatim is a defect even though the registry is otherwise the better source.

### Combining Results

The web-form autofill cascade can run in the order DataCite, Zenodo, SoMEF, then PyHC, but AI extraction should not treat that cascade as a global source-priority rule.

Use field-specific priority when sources conflict:
- Primary repository files and structured citation metadata are authoritative for fields they directly define, such as license, authors, package name, version, and documentation.
- DataCite and Zenodo are authoritative for DOI-hosted metadata, but DOI roles must be classified carefully. A reference-publication DOI should not be used as the software persistent identifier.
- PyHC metadata is curated and should be prioritized when the package identity match is strong, especially for name, description, documentation, logo, and keywords.
- SoMEF is automated and can be wrong. Treat it as useful candidate/corroborating evidence, not as an authoritative source over repository files or curated metadata.
- Software Functionality, Related Region, and Related Phenomena require domain synthesis from README/docs, code capability evidence, PyHC hints, and any publications.

## General notes on extracting from a repository

<!-- Intro and closing sentences of the former RSFF "Notes for AI Agents"; the 16 numbered items moved to their fields. -->

When extracting metadata from a GitHub repository to fill this form:

Many fields are domain-specific (heliophysics) and may require understanding of the software's scientific purpose, which might be found in papers, documentation, or descriptive text in the README.

## Literature sources (when the repository is thin or absent)

<!-- moved from .claude/agents/hssi-metadata-extractor.md:190-226 -->
Some HSSI software has no source repository at all. A model or product page — a CCMC model page, a
mission software page — is then the authoritative source and a valid Field 3. Extract what is
discoverable and accept a thinner dossier; never invent a repository URL.

When the repo cannot supply a field, the literature usually can:

- **A publisher 402/403 is usually bot-blocking, not a paywall** — the article may be fully open
  access. Setting a browser User-Agent does *not* defeat it, and Unpaywall/Semantic Scholar often
  report an "open access" location that is the same blocked publisher URL. The portable route is
  **Europe PMC**: query
  `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/search?query=DOI:"<doi>"&resultType=core&format=json`,
  and if it returns `inEPMC=Y`, the corresponding PMC article page is readable by ordinary fetch,
  acknowledgements included. Coverage is partial — expect it to miss most AGU/Wiley papers.
  **If no route works, report it as a blocker in your result rather than recording the field as
  unavailable.** A browser renders these pages fine, and the orchestrator may have one; it can fetch
  the text and re-invoke you with it.
- **A paper's Acknowledgments and Data Availability Statement are the best source for Fields 25/26,**
  and are where code/data DOIs surface. See Field 25 in `hssi-field-definitions` for why they beat
  Crossref's funding block.
- **ADS/Sci-X needs no personal API token.** `GET https://scixplorer.org/v1/accounts/bootstrap`
  returns an anonymous token, usable as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` against
  `https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/query`. It supports `ack:` (acknowledgements section),
  `body:`, `full:`, proximity (`"a b"~N`) and fuzzy (`word~`). When the full text is unreachable,
  `ack:"<award>" bibcode:<paper>` still works as a membership probe — enough to settle which awards a
  paper acknowledges without reading it. Validate with controls: a nonsense token must return 0, and
  an award you believe absent should still be findable in *other* papers, proving real absence rather
  than a tokenization artifact. If the bootstrap stops working, it was a convenience route to
  full-text search — fall back to the routes above.
- **Semantic Scholar** (`api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1`, no key) gives the citation graph, and its
  citation `contexts`/`intents` separate substantive use from a passing mention — which is what
  Fields 27 and 30 turn on. **OpenAlex** is open but its `grants` field is often null; don't rely on
  it for funders.

Searching the software's name alone misses artifacts that never name it. Award numbers, the PI's name,
or a companion dataset title are often better queries.

## Reaching blocked or tokenless sources (validator notes)

<!-- moved from .claude/agents/hssi-metadata-validator.md:171-173 -->
- A source returning 402/403 to an automated fetch is often bot-blocking, not genuine unavailability; the article may be fully open access. Try Europe PMC (`.../europepmc/webservices/rest/search?query=DOI:"<doi>"&resultType=core&format=json`; if `inEPMC=Y`, the PMC page is readable by ordinary fetch). A browser User-Agent does not defeat the block. If no route works, report the claim as **unverified for lack of access** rather than unsupported, and say which routes you tried — the orchestrator may have a browser and can supply the text
- **ADS/Sci-X needs no personal API token.** `GET https://scixplorer.org/v1/accounts/bootstrap` returns an anonymous token, usable as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` against `https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/search/query`. It supports `ack:` (acknowledgements section), `body:`, `full:`, proximity (`"a b"~N`) and fuzzy (`word~`). A report of "no ADS token available, claim unreproducible" is therefore a wrong premise, not a finding: run the bootstrap, re-check the claim, and validate with controls — a nonsense token must return 0, and a term you believe absent should still be findable in *other* records, so a real 0 is distinguishable from an auth failure. If the bootstrap stops working, fall back to the routes above.
